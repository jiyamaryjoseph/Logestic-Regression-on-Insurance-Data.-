# LogRegression-on ML-(Insurance-Data/ iris dataset)

## Gradient Descent in Neural Network.(Deeplearning-(Insurance-Data))
 Gradient Descent is a term that you will often hear in Neural Network. Indeed, the optimization/learning phase of Neural Network (backpropagation) use gradient descent as a method to update the various weight.
   The insurance_data.csv is attached here.By using this data here I am predicting the chance of taking insurance by age and affordability..In this data age and afffordability are the features.Scaling is also using on age for improving accuracy. 
    For reducing loss here i am using log loss function and To get range (0,1) by sigmoid function..
